# password-generator-homework

## In this home work I was assigned to get a password generator working and displaying a password for the user

## I did struggle on this homework in spite of having alot of help. SOme of the concepts are lost on me but I intend to keep coming back to this homework.

## The most difficult portion was getting the finished password to display. I have a feeling I was missing the point where the return statement went. In the end with alot of hard digging and some help from the team I got the password to display. However, I ran out of time to get the password length control in place. I will be returning to try and implement that in the near future.

### Thank you for the time and I do appreciate any feed-back I can get.
